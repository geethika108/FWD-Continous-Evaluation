    Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a field of study that combines computer science principles with engineering practices.
    It focuses on how computers work—both in theory and in practice—and teaches students to design, develop, and maintain hardware, software, and intelligent systems.

    CSE is the study of computing systems, programming, algorithms, data structures, and computer hardware. 
    It trains students to build software applications, design computer systems, work with networks and databases, and apply computational thinking to solve real-world problems.
